# Movies-Streaming

A movie streaming website is a website that allows users to stream movies and TV shows online. Users can browse through a catalog of movies and TV shows, and choose to watch them on demand.

Movie streaming websites are becoming increasingly popular as an alternative to traditional cable TV, as they offer more flexibility and convenience for users. They can be accessed on a variety of devices, including smartphones, tablets, and desktop computers, and allow users to watch movies and TV shows at their own pace, rather than being tied to a schedule.
